Swap the type of an object at run-time. Have party! Rule the world!

So, there I was, in Objective-C class with @stevenharman, and I learned about the isa method. Well, thought I, what would happen if I could set it to something else. Could I change the type and implementation of the object? Seemed like a better idea than stripping down naked, so I tried it. Sure enough, it worked. This code is the result of taking that idea further.
